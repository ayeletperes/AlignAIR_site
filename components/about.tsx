              <p className="text-xl text-gray-400 mb-4">
                The analysis of Adaptive Immune Receptor Repertoire sequencing (AIRR-seq) data is critical for understanding the dynamics of the adaptive immune system in health and disease. While many algorithms and tools are available for Immunoglobulin (Ig) sequence alignment, each exhibits specific strengths and weaknesses. AlignAIR was developed to harness a novel multi-task residual convolutional architecture along with an immunology-informed loss function to overcome these weaknesses.

                <h3 className="h3 mb-3">Comprehensive Sequence Analysis</h3>
                <p className="text-xl text-gray-400 mb-4">
                  AlignAIR integrates a deep residual convolutional architecture with a novel loss function and training regime, enabling effective modeling of Ig sequences. Using the immune receptor sequence simulator, GenAIRR, we generated high-quality training and validation datasets.

                <h3 className="h3 mb-3">Superior Performance</h3>
                <p className="text-xl text-gray-400 mb-4">
                  AlignAIR was benchmarked against leading aligners, showing superior performance in segmentation tasks, allele classification, and productivity classification, especially under high Somatic Hypermutation (SHM) conditions. It accurately models SHM dynamics and resolves uncertainties by prioritizing alleles with higher mutability.

                <h3 className="h3 mb-3">Robust Against Sequence Corruption</h3>
                <p className="text-xl text-gray-400 mb-4">
                  AlignAIRâ€™s robust performance indicates its enhanced ability to deal with sequence corruptions and complex mutation patterns, which are often seen in clinical samples. It transcends classic alignment algorithms by integrating multiple metatasks into its latent space, allowing it to consider multiple aspects simultaneously when making an alignment.
